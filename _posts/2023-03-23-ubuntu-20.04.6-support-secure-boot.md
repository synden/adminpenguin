Canonical, the maker of Ubuntu, [announced](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2023-March/000287.html) today the release of Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS as a refreshed installer media for Desktop and Server flavors that adds support for modern hardware and the latest security fixes.

Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS is here as the sixth and probably the last point release to the long-term supported Ubuntu [20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)](https://9to5linux.com/ubuntu-20-04-lts-focal-fossa-is-now-certified-for-the-raspberry-pi) operating system series, which Canonical pledged to support until April 2025 for regular users and until April 2030 for enterprise users who purchase the ESM (Extended Security Maintenance) package.

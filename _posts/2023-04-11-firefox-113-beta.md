In the latest Firefox 113 Beta release, there are significant updates and improvements. Firefox for Android now has hardware accelerated AV1 video decoding enabled by default for supported devices, or it will fallback to software decoding. GPU-accelerated Canvas2D is also enabled by default on Firefox for Android. Additionally, Firefox 113 Beta includes better password generation that now includes special characters, enhancing security.

The update also features improved Picture-in-Picture mode, drag-and-drop functionality from Microsoft Outlook on Windows, and support for FIDO2/WebAuthn authenticators over USB on macOS and Linux. These changes make Firefox 113 Beta a noteworthy update. The release is available for download from [Mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/113.0beta/releasenotes/). The stable release is expected to come out around 9 May.

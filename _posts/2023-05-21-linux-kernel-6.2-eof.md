## Introduction
The [Linux 6.2 kernel](https://9to5linux.com/linux-kernel-6-2-officially-released-this-is-whats-new) series has reached its End of Life (EOL) on the [kernel.org](http://kernel.org/) website, meaning it will no longer receive bug and security fixes. Released on February 19th, 2023, Linux 6.2 introduced new features such as protective load balancing (PLB) for IPv6, a FineIBT control-flow integrity mechanism for x86, support for Intel's "asynchronous exit notification" mechanism, and improved Rust infrastructure.

The renowned kernel developer and maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the release of the final version, Linux 6.2.16, and urged users to upgrade to the latest [Linux 6.3](https://9to5linux.com/linux-kernel-6-3-officially-released-this-is-whats-new) kernel series promptly. Rolling-release distributions like Arch Linux, openSUSE Tumbleweed, and their derivatives already employ the Linux 6.3 series. Other popular distributions like Fedora Linux 38 will soon receive the Linux 6.3 kernel upgrade, while Ubuntu users can follow a [tutorial](https://9to5linux.com/you-can-now-install-linux-kernel-6-3-on-ubuntu-heres-how) to upgrade. Those interested can download and compile the latest Linux 6.3 kernel from the [kernel.org](http://kernel.org/) website.

Released on April 23rd, 2023, Linux kernel 6.3 brought new features like an Intel VPU DRM accelerated driver, BIG TCP support for IPv4, Rust code support for x86_64 user-mode Linux, support for the "ZBB" bit-manipulation extension for RISC-V kernels, and native Steam Deck controller support. However, Linux 6.3 is not an LTS series and will reach EOL at the end of July. Users will then be encouraged to upgrade to the upcoming Linux 6.4 series, anticipated to be released at the end of June or in early July 2023.

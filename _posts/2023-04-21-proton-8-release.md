Valve released today Proton 8.0 as the latest version of their open-source compatibility tool for Steam Play based on Wine and additional components for those of you who want to play Windows games on your GNU/Linux systems.

[According to Valve](https://twitter.com/Plagman2/status/1648029861032890368), Proton 8.0 is the biggest update to date bringing support for numerous Windows games that you can now play on your Linux box.

Though, keep in mind that with the release of Proton 8.0, a GPU with at least Vulkan 1.3 support is required to run it smoothly.


Some of the biggest highlights among the games include:
* Forspoken
* Samurai Maiden
* Dead Space (2023)
* Creativerse
* Nioh 2 - The Complete Edition
* One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4
* Atelier Meruru

* ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS XIV
* ToGather:Island
* WARRIORS OROCHI 3 Ultimate Definitive Edition
* Exceed - Gun Bullet Children
* Gungrave G.O.R.E.

Additionally, there are improvements that should help Steam Deck users, including:
* Improved sleep/resume functionality on Steam Deck for Tiny Tina's Wonderland.
* Improved multitouch support


Proton 8.0 improves multi-touch support, improves support for the game launcher from 2K, fixes Alt+Tab issues on the GNOME 43 series desktop, and enables NVIDIA API (NVAPI) for many games. Valve also notes the fact that this major Proton release requires a graphics card that supports [Vulkan 1.3](https://9to5linux.com/vulkan-1-3-released-with-dynamic-rendering-improved-synchronization-api).

Under the hood, Proton 8.0 comes with updated core components like Wine 8.0, wine-mono 7.4.1, dxvk 2.1-4-gcaf31033, vkd3d-proton 2.8-84-g08909d98, and dxvk-nvapi 0.6.2.

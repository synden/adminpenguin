## Updates available, v24 no longer maintained.
As always, minor releases include stability and security improvements that are designed to be a safe and quick upgrade.

The [changelog](https://nextcloud.com/changelog/) is updated! There you can find all the fixes and improvements for these releases on our website.
<br />
<br />

**Note:** There will be no more releases of Nextcloud Hub 2 (24.0.x). Upgrade to Nextcloud Enterprise to continue to get security and stability updates or move to Nextcloud Hub 4 (26.0.x) or Hub 3 (25.0.x). Don’t forget that running web-facing software without regular updates is risky. Please stay up to date with Nextcloud releases of both the server and its apps, for the safety of your data! Customers can always count on our upgrade support if needed.

**Note²:** PHP 7.4 is *no longer officially supported by the PHP community*. Nextcloud has supported PHP 8.0 and newer versions for some time now, and we strongly recommend you move to a newer version of PHP. Version 8.0 is already out of active support (!) and has only 7 months of security updates left. Nextcloud Hub 3 (25.0.x) deprecates PHP 7.4 but still works with it. We strongly recommend you use PHP 8.1 or newer. Our Hub 4 release has dropped 7.4 support while introducing support for PHP 8.2.

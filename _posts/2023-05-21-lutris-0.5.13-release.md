Lutris 0.5.13, the latest version of the popular open-source game manager, has been released with several exciting features.

With Lutris, Linux gamers can easily organize their extensive collection of games from different platforms such as Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, emulators, and more. One notable addition in Lutris v0.5.13 is the restored support for running Windows games using Proton. It is recommended to use the builds provided by Lutris, which currently utilize GloriousEggroll's Proton builds.

Moreover, Lutris 0.5.13 significantly improves responsiveness, especially for users with large game libraries. The update also brings various user interface enhancements, including the ability to drag and drop items in the main window.

In addition to these improvements, Lutris 0.5.13 introduces integration with Battle.net and Itch.io, enhances HiDPI support for custom media, detects obsolete Vulkan drivers, improves detection of DOSBox games on GOG, and offers various other enhancements.

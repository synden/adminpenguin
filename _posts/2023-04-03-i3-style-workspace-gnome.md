If you're after an i3-style workspaces bar in GNOME Shell you need to check out the latest version of the [Space Bar](https://github.com/christopher-l/space-bar) extension.

Inspired by (now defunct) Workspaces Bar, Space Bar replaces the Activities label in GNOME Shell's top panel with an applet that shows numbers.

Each number is an available workspace, and the numbers appear/disappear based on how many workspaces you create. There's a "+" at the end to add new workspaces.

Now a variant of the famous Clop hostage program has appeared for Linux. Something that was first discovered by [Sentinel Labs](https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/cl0p-ransomware-targets-linux-systems-with-flawed-encryption-decryptor-available/) reports [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/linux-variant-of-clop-ransomware.html). The Linux variant of Clop is said to have been used to try to attack several educational organizations in Colombia.

However, the clop variant should contain a flawed encryption algorithm, making it possible to decrypt affected content without paying any ransom to the attackers. Sentinel Labs has also released a [decryptor](https://github.com/SentineLabs/Cl0p-ELF-Decryptor) for the Linux variant that is free to use. However, the security company warns that more Linux-adapted hostage programs are expected in the future.
